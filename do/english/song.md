You don't know what's going on 
You've been away for much too long 
You can't come back and think you are still mine
You're out of touch, my baby 
My poor old fashioned baby 
I said, baby, baby, baby, you're out of time
Well, baby, baby, baby, you're out of time 
I said, baby, baby, baby, you're out of time
You are all left out
Out of there without a doubt 
'Cause baby, baby, baby, you're out of time

You thought you were a clever girl giving up your social whirl
But you can't come back and be the first in line, oh no
You're obsolete, my baby, my poor old fashioned baby
I said baby, baby, baby you're out of time
Well, baby, baby, baby, you're out of time 
I said, baby, baby, baby, you're out of time 
Yes, you are all left out 
Out of there without a doubt 
'Cause baby, baby, baby, you're out of time

Sing your song
Baby, baby, baby, you're out of time 
I said, baby, baby, baby, you're out of time
Yes, you are all left out 
Out of there without a doubt 
'Cause baby, baby, baby, you're out of time
