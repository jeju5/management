You don't know what's going on
You've been away for much too long
You can't come back and think you are still mine

You're out of touch, my baby
My poor old-fashioned baby
I said, baby, baby, baby, you're out of time

Well, baby, baby, baby, you're out of time
I said, baby, baby, baby, you're out of time
Yes, you are left out, yes, you are
I said you're, left outta door without a doubt
'Cause baby, baby, baby, you're out of time

You thought you were a clever girl (Clever girl)
Giving up your social whirl (Social whirl)
But You can't come back, be the first in line, oh yeaheah

You're obsolete, my baby
My poor old faithful baby
I said baby, baby, baby, you're out of time

Well, baby, baby, baby, you're out of time
I said, baby, baby, baby, you're out of time
Yes, you are left out, yes, you are
I said you're, left outta door without a doubt
'Cause baby, baby, baby, you're out of time

Sing your song
Baby, baby, baby, you're out of time
I said, baby, baby, baby, you're out of time
Yes, you are left out, yes, you are
I said you're left out, out of there without a doubt
'Cause baby, baby, baby, you're out of time
Baby, baby, baby, you're out of time
I said, baby, baby, baby, you're out of time
