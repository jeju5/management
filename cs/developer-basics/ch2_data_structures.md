## 1. List
* List
```
* List is a collection of ordered data.

* List vs Array
    * List
        * collection of ordered data.
        * direct access is not always allowed. ArrayList supports it but not LinkedList.     
    * Array
        * collection of ordered data in consecutive memory. (+consecutive memory is the keypoint)
        * direct access is allowed.
    * In Java
        * Size: List is an interface with dynamic size, but Array is a fixed-size datatype; []
        * Content: List can hold Reference Type but not Primitive Type. Array can hold both.
        * Type-Safety: List can be non-typesafe, meaning List can contain two different types of data at the same time. However, array is typesafe by default.
