# CH2. Data Structures

## 1. List
* List
* List is a collection of ordered data.
* List vs Array
    * List
        * collection of ordered data.
		* direct access is not always allowed. ArrayList supports it but not LinkedList.     
	* Array
		* collection of ordered data in consecutive memory. (+consecutive memory is the keypoint)
		* direct access is allowed.
	* In Java
		* Size: List is an interface with dynamic size, but Array is a fixed-size datatype; []
		* Content: List can hold Reference Type but not Primitive Type. Array can hold both.
		* Type-Safety: List can be non-typesafe, meaning List can contain two different types of data at the same time. However, array is typesafe by default.

* Array List
    * ArrayList is an implementation of List using dynamic array concept.

    * Singly Linked List
    * Doubly Linked List
    * Circular Linked List
