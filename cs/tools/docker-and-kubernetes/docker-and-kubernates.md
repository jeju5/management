## Docker and Kubernetes: The Complete Guide

# Install Docker on Mac
  * sign up for docker hub
    * jexxx009

# What is Docker?
  * Docker Client(CLI), Docker Server and Docker Hub
    ```
    docker run hello-world
    ```
    * docker run = docker create + docker start.
      * docker create command creates a container.
      * docker start starts a container.    
      * when you run the command above for the first time, docker client asks docker server for hello-world image. (note that       docker client and docker server is at local)
    * docker server looks at image cache where it realizes image cache doesn't have the image.
    * docker server downloads hello-world image from docker hub
  * Image
    * a file that describes a program configuration and startup commands.
    * = FS snapshot + startup commands; (FS = file system)
  * Container
    * a namespaced resources that runs a process(s). (partition of resources)
      * Namespace (Linux Namespace) is a feature of Linux kernel to partition resources for processes.
    
# Docker containers
  ```
  docker run busy-box ls
  ```
  * busybox is a lite-weight linux program.
  
  ```
  docker ps
  ```
  * lists currently running containers.
  
  ```
  docker ps --all
  ```
  * lists history of containers.
  
  ```
  docker create hello-world
  ```
  * returns a container id (for example, ab92295e9859a86ff59d7a43cd7d4294151e37740465d64c50b3e913c7e22dd5)
  
  ```
  docker start ab92295e9859a86ff59d7a43cd7d4294151e37740465d64c50b3e913c7e22dd5
  docker start -a ab92295e9859a86ff59d7a43cd7d4294151e37740465d64c50b3e913c7e22dd5
  ```
  * docker start will simply start a container, and -a flag will print out logs generated from the container.
  ```
  docker run busybox echo hi there
  docker ps --all 
  (assume ddf1b6421e72 is the busybox container id generated by command above)
  docker start ddf1b6421e72
  docker start -a ddf1b6421e72
  ```
  * you can start a previously created container with its container id.
  ```
  docker start -a ddf1b6421e72 bye there
  ```
  * this command will fail because you can not replace the startup commands of a previously created container.
