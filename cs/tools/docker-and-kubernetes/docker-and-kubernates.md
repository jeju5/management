## Docker and Kubernetes: The Complete Guide

# What is Docker?
  * Docker Client(CLI), Docker Server and Docker Hub
    ```
    docker run hello-world
    ```
    * docker run = docker create + docker start.
      * docker create command creates a container.
      * docker start starts a container.    
      * when you run the command above for the first time, docker client asks docker server for hello-world image. (note that       docker client and docker server is at local)
    * docker server looks at image cache where it realizes image cache doesn't have the image.
    * docker server downloads hello-world image from docker hub
  * Image
    * a file that describes a program configuration and startup commands.
    * = FS snapshot + startup commands; (FS = file system)
  * Container
    * a namespaced resources that runs a process(s). (partition of resources)
      * Namespace (Linux Namespace) is a feature of Linux kernel to partition resources for processes.
    
# Docker containers (section 2)
  ```
  docker run busy-box ls
  ```
  * busybox is a lite-weight linux program.
  
  ```
  docker ps
  ```
  * lists currently running containers.
  
  ```
  docker ps --all
  ```
  * lists currently existing containers. (containers can exist without being started = stop)
  
  ```
  docker create hello-world
  ```
  * returns a container id (for example, ab92295e9859a86ff59d7a43cd7d4294151e37740465d64c50b3e913c7e22dd5)
  
  ```
  docker start ab92295e9859a86ff59d7a43cd7d4294151e37740465d64c50b3e913c7e22dd5
  docker start -a ab92295e9859a86ff59d7a43cd7d4294151e37740465d64c50b3e913c7e22dd5
  ```
  * docker start will simply start a container, and -a flag will print out logs generated from the container.
  ```
  docker run busybox echo hi there
  docker ps --all 
  (assume ddf1b6421e72 is the busybox container id generated by command above)
  docker start ddf1b6421e72
  docker start -a ddf1b6421e72
  ```
  * you can start a previously created container with its container id.
  ```
  docker start -a ddf1b6421e72 bye there
  ```
  * this command will fail because you can not replace the startup commands of a previously created container.
    * you will see an error message: 'you cannot start and attach multiple containers at once'
  ```
  docker system prune
  ```
  * this command will delete some resources including image-cache and stopped containers.
  ```
  docker create busybox echo hi there -->  e37740465d64c50b3e913c7e22dd5
  docker start e37740465d64c50b3e913c7e22dd5  -->  k37740465d64c50b3e913c7e22aa6
  docker logs k37740465d64c50b3e913c7e22aa6 --> hi there
  ```
  * docker logs doesn't actually start a container. It will simply bring out the any messages generated from having started a   container. note that 'docker start e37740465d64c50b3e913c7e22dd5' itself won't generate a message to us.
  ```
  docker stop e37740465d64c50b3e913c7e22dd5
  docker kill e37740465d64c50b3e913c7e22dd5
  ```
  * docker stop command will send SIGTERM signal to a container to stop the container itself. (allows clean up itself)
  * docker kill command will send SIGKILL signal to a container to kill the container process right awaw.
  ```
  docker run redis
  ```
  * redis is an in-memory database program. when you run redis, you can use redis-cli to interact with redis database.
  however, you can't directly interact with the container that you just created for running redis. you need to get inside
  the container that is running and execute a second command for redis-cli operations.
  ```
  (assume 06c404248d22 is the container-id of docker redis)
  docker exec 06c404248d22 redis-cli
  docker exec -it 06c404248d22 redis-cli
  ```
  * exec allows you to execute additional commands inside the container.
  * -it = -i -t
    * -i: attach my terminal to the STDIN of the container you exec (stuff we typed goes to the STDIN of redis-cli in this 
    case)
    * -t: format the output text coming from the exec commmand
