# Pretty Woman

Pretty woman, walkin' down the street
Pretty woman the kind I like to meet
Pretty woman I don't believe you, you're not the truth
No one could look as good as you, mercy
Pretty woman won't you pardon me
Pretty woman I couldn't help but see
Pretty woman that you look lovely as can be
Are you lonely just like me
Pretty woman stop awhile
Pretty woman talk awhile
Pretty woman give your smile to me
Pretty woman yeah, yeah, yeah
Pretty woman look my way
Pretty woman say you'll stay with me
'Cause I need you, I'll treat you right
Come with me baby, be mine tonight
Pretty woman don't walk on by
Pretty woman don't make me cry
Pretty woman don't walk away, hey, OK
If that's the way it must be, OK
I guess I'll go on home, it's late
There'll be tomorrow night, but wait
What do I see?
Is she walkin' back to me?
Yeah, she's walkin' back to me
Oh, oh, pretty woman.

# You've Got a Friend in Me - Randy Newman

You've got a friend in me
You've got a friend in me
When the road looks rough ahead
And you're miles and miles
From your nice warm bed
You just remember what your old pal said
Boy, you've got a friend in me
Yeah, you've got a friend in me
You've got a friend in me
You've got a friend in me
If you've got troubles, I've got 'em too
There isn't anything I wouldn't do for you
We stick together and can see it through
'Cause you've got a friend in me
Yeah, you've got a friend in me
Some other folks might be
A little bit smarter than I am
Bigger and stronger too, maybe
But none of them will ever love you
The way I do, it's me and you, boy
And as the years go by
Our friendship will never die
You're gonna see it's our destiny
You've got a friend in me
You've got a friend in me
Yeah, you've got a friend in me

You don't know what's going on
You've been away for much too long
You can't come back and think you are still mine

You're out of touch, my baby
My poor old-fashioned baby
I said, baby, baby, baby, you're out of time

Well, baby, baby, baby, you're out of time
I said, baby, baby, baby, you're out of time
Yes, you are left out, yes, you are
I said you're, left outta door without a doubt
'Cause baby, baby, baby, you're out of time

You thought you were a clever girl (Clever girl)
Giving up your social whirl (Social whirl)
But You can't come back, be the first in line, oh yeaheah

You're obsolete, my baby
My poor old faithful baby
I said baby, baby, baby, you're out of time

Well, baby, baby, baby, you're out of time
I said, baby, baby, baby, you're out of time
Yes, you are left out, yes, you are
I said you're, left outta door without a doubt
'Cause baby, baby, baby, you're out of time

Sing your song
Baby, baby, baby, you're out of time
I said, baby, baby, baby, you're out of time
Yes, you are left out, yes, you are
I said you're left out, out of there without a doubt
'Cause baby, baby, baby, you're out of time
Baby, baby, baby, you're out of time
I said, baby, baby, baby, you're out of time
